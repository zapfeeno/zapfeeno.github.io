    <h1>The Triassic Period</h1>

    <p>
      The Triassic began 251 million years ago and ended 201 million years ago.  The animals 
      that existed during this time are the ancestors to the dinosaurs we most recognize, and also 
      the ancestors to mammals today!  Some creatures that existed during the Triassic Period
      are below:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Lystrosaurus</dt>
            <dd>
                A therapsid, or "mammal-like reptile".  The therapsids became mostly
                extinct by the end of the Triassic due to being outcompeted by other
                predators.  The therapsids were also the evolutionary link between
                reptiles and mammals.
            </dd>
        <dt>Morganucodon</dt>
            <dd>
                One of the first true mammals, this was a small creature
                resembling a shrew.
            </dd>
        <dt>Coelophysis</dt>
            <dd>
                A part of the thecodont group, which will later evolve into the dinosaurs
                we recognize, was a bipedal predator about 2 meters long.
